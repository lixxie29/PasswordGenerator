# Technical Challenge

## The problem

Develop a system that can generate a one-time password for a banking
application. The OTP system must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly to
enhance the user experience and protect customers' data.
 
## Business Requirements

1. The OTP system must be secure to protect the confidential data of the customers.
It must ensure that OTPs are generated randomly and are not predictable.
Encryption during transmission of the OTPs should also be ensured.
2. The OTPs should be time-bound. Once generated, an OTP should not be valid
indefinitely. The system should automatically invalidate the OTP after a
certain period of time that can be easily customized.
3. The OTP input interface should be user-friendly. It should allow users to
input the OTP easily without any confusion.
4. The system should have good error handling. It should inform the user about
any issues in a clear and understandable way.
5. For the purpose of this exercise, the user should receive the OTP in
a toast message that will be visible as long as the OTP is valid.

## Techincal requirements

1. The solution must be a web application developed on the latest .NET framework.
2. For the frontend part you can use any javascript framework you want.
3. Unit tests must be performed with a test coverage of at least 70%.

## Evaluation
Your solution will be evaluated based on coding and testability standards,
naming conventions, project structure and the meeting of requirements. It must
be uploaded in a public github repository that can be accessed by us for validation.
